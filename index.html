        <p>Hi, my names is Nazia, and I completed my graduation as a biomedical engineer from Dubai. 
            Due to me migrating several places because of family commitments, I had to take a break in my career. 
            Since the day I moved to California, I have been struggling in my career. I would like to become a developer in medical field.
        And I am sure this programming course certification that I am doing would definitely help me in opting my career path.
    Any suggestions to boost my career are always welcome.</p>
